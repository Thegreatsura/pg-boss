/**
 * Adapts a `Bun.SQL` client to pg-boss's IDatabase, for running pg-boss on Bun's built-in
 * PostgreSQL driver instead of the bundled `pg` pool.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { SQL } from 'bun'
 * import { PgBoss, fromBunSql } from 'pg-boss'
 *
 * const boss = new PgBoss({ db: fromBunSql(new SQL(connectionString)) })
 * await boss.start()
 * ```
 *
 * The caller owns the client's lifecycle: pg-boss never calls `end()` on it.
 *
 * `useListenNotify` needs `sql.listen()`, which Bun added in 1.4.0. On an older runtime the adapter
 * exposes no `listen` and pg-boss falls back to polling.
